    Hello! I'm Ernest (iFire) Lee, and I'm based in beautiful Vancouver, BC, Canada. I spend my days creating with the game engine Godot Engine, and I absolutely love diving into deep technical challenges. To me, building tools to bring virtual worlds to life and work on complex systems like full-body Inverse Kinematics and 3d formats (glTF2, FBX, Khronos Group) aren't just lines of code; they're fascinating puzzles. I've had the amazing experience of helping work on the large-scale tactical world of Squad, creating systems to support the publisher operations of Offworld Industries. My passion for community also extends to my open-source VR Social Network System work with V-Sekai. That same spirit of teamwork is probably why you can often find me playing League of Legends as a support main with Nami or Sona.
